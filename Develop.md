## GitHub Tools GUI Application

If you try to deploy GUI application,please use this project's core.

But please contact [githut@macwinlin.ml](mailto:githut@macwinlin.ml)!

And if you(or your team)'s project is very fantastic,we will add your project to official GUI application list(will write author).

## GitHub Tools Shell Application

This application want to rewrite?

OK,if you want to rewrite shell,[contact us](mailto:githut@macwinlin.ml)!

**But unofficial shell application's probability of joining official is small.**

## GitHub Tools Language Core

Really,we want Language Core to include more languages.

So you can modify language core to anymore!

Then send new core to [us](mailto:githut@macwinlin.ml)!

## GitHub Tools Main Core

Why modify main core?Because you want to deploy GUI application?OK!

**But unofficial shell application's probability of joining official is small.**

**The probability is smaller than Shell**

Please know,main core's update time maybe very fast,so please update your main core fast too.

Maybe it's a little update,only modify one line code.

You can add more function in your core.

Maybe your application is good!Better than ours!
