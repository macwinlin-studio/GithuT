If you try to develop other version,please contact [githut@macwinlin.ml](mailto:githut@macwinlin.ml)!

## Version

### GitHub Tools GUI Application

If you try to develop GUI application,please use this project's core.But you can use other cores,too.

And if you use our core,please contact [githut@macwinlin.ml](mailto:githut@macwinlin.ml)!

And if you(or your team)'s project is very fantastic,we will add your project to official GUI application list(will write author).

### GitHub Tools Shell Application

This application want to rewrite?

OK,if you want to rewrite shell,[contact us](mailto:githut@macwinlin.ml)!

**But unofficial shell application's probability of joining official is small.**

### GitHub Tools Language Core

Really,we want Language Core to include more languages.

So you can modify language core and publish to anymore!

Then send new core to [us](mailto:githut@macwinlin.ml)!

### GitHub Tools Main Core

Why modify main core?Because you want to develop GUI application?OK!

**But unofficial shell application's probability of joining official is small.**

**The probability is smaller than Shell**

Please know,main core's update time maybe very fast,so please update your main core fast too.

Maybe it's a little update,only modify one line code.

You can add more function in your core.

Maybe your application is good!Better than ours!

### GitHub Tools Backup Core

You can rewrite this core.

But please use this mode to make backup file,then this file can use in our version,too!

#### Step 1:

e.g. Database:

![Database](https://s1.imagehub.cc/images/2022/05/01/Snipaste_2022-05-01_15-14-23.jpg)

Then the backup file is a compressed file(suffix is *.zip*)

--------

A backup file:

backup-0000-0-00-000000<i>.backup</i>(original suffix is *.zip*)

|-backup-0000-0-00-000000.json

|-backup-0000-0-00-000000.sha256

#### Step 2

Make these two files.

*backup-0000-0-00-000000.json*'s text is:

```json
{"ver": 1.0, "data": ["zh-cn", 0, "123456", 0, 0]}
```

And *backup-0000-0-00-000000.sha256*'s text is:

**7b6ad5b57789578e5b5a39af262adb278197b5a795e4dd7c64be488fb4f43502**

Yes,*.sha256* file's text is *.json*'s SHA256 value.

#### Step 3

Then change compressed file's suffix to *.backup*.

In the end,the backup file's name is **_backup-0000-0-00-000000.backup_**(backup-*yyyy*-*mm*-*dd*-*random number(100000-1000000)*.backup
